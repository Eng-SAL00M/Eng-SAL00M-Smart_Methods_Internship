- In this task, we utilize TurtleBot3 with SLAM approach to create and save a map.
- We followed the instructions highlighted on Turtlebot3 web page at: "https://emanual.robotis.com/docs/en/platform/turtlebot3"
- Initially, we launch TurtleBot3 simulation world using Gazebo environment.
- Then, we started running SLAM Node with the Gmapping method. 
- Finally, we run the Teleoperation Node to control the TurtleBot and make the mapping.
