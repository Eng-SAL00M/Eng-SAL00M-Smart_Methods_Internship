In this task we create the joints for the head movements of the robot.
Two 3D models of MG996R servos were imported from GrabCad website.
One was attached with round type horn and the other was attached with U type bracket.
The one with the U type bracket was mounted on top of the one with round type horn. 
The servo in the base gives the head of the robot the ability to move right and left, whereas the top servo enables the up and down movement.
